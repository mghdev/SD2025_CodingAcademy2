# Write a function called 'makeChange'
# It should take an amount of money as an argument
# The goal of the function is to figure out how to make that amount of money with the smallest number of coins possible
# Assume there are 4 types of coin respectively worth 25 (quarters), 10 (dimes), 5 (nickels), and 1 (pennies) 
# Your function should return a list of 4 ints, corresponding to the number of each type of coin needed to equal the amount of money you're trying to make
# The first element of the list should be the number of quarters, then dimes, then nickels, then pennies
# For example:
#   makeChange(31) should return [1,0,1,1]
#   makeChange(75) should return [3,0,0,0]
#   makeChange(14) should return [0,1,0,4]
