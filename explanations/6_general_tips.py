# 1. ALWAYS run your code. Make sure it does what you want/expect.

# 2. Break programs down into multiple pieces that you can try to write one at a time.
# Write only the code you need for the piece you're working on, then *run your code*

# 3. Tips for making up names, test cases, and values
#   If you need to make a variable and aren't sure what to call it, use short names like 1-3 letters or a letter and a number
#   For example:
#       a = 0
#       s = "green"
#       x1 = -2.5
#   You can always come back later and change a name if you think of a better one.
#
#   When making up numbers for a test or other literal value, here is a checklist to go through that can help you think of more values to use:
#       Can I use 0?
#       Can I use negative numbers?
#       Can I use decimals or is it supposed to only be int?
#       Use at least one number less than 10, and one greater than 10
#       For int, use at least one even and one odd number
#
#   For example:
#       int_list = [-2,5,0,12]
#
#   If I need to fill a list, I also sometimes like to use sequences of numbers, like:
#       Even numbers:   [2,4,6,8,10]
#       Powers of 2:    [2,4,8,16,32]
#       Prime numbers:  [2,3,5,7,11,13]
#
#   For making up strings, I often go for single words and start by picking the first letter and proceeding alphabetically.
#   e.g. How about I start with h... hamburger. i... icarus. j... jelly. k... knock   etc.
#       s1 = "xylophone"
#       s2 = "yellow"
#       s3 = "zebra"
