# This file does not print any output; you should follow along in interactive mode.
# A sequence is a numbered ('indexed') collection of objects.
# The first object in a sequence has index 0, and each subsequent object has +1 index
# We will mainly use the sequence types 'list' and 'str' in this course. I will make occasional mention of 'tuple' and 'range' as well.

# A list is a sequence of objects of any type. Literal lists are written as comma-separated expressions between square brackets []
int_list = [0,1,2,3,4]
float_list = [2.3, 4.1, 6.9, 10.2]
str_list = ["a","Mark","wow"]
list_list = [[2,1],["q","s"]]
mixed_list = [-4.5,"str",[0],42]

# You can access items in a list by index using the subscript operator, which is also a pair of square brackets []
# A list value followed by square brackets with an index inside evaluates to one element from the list, like so:
int_list[4]   # 4
float_list[0] # 2.3
str_list[1]   # "Mark"
list_list[1]  # ["q","s"]
i = 0
mixed_list[i]
# The index passed into the subscript operator MUST be an int. It cannot be a float, even if the float is equal to some integer.

# Negative indices in the subscript operator count backwards from the end, with index -1 being the final element
int_list[-2]    # 3
float_list[-1]  # 10.2
mixed_list[-3]  # "str"

# the len() function can take a list as an argument and returns the number of elements in the list
len(int_list)   # 5
len(list_list)  # 2

# lists can be concatenated with the '+' operator. This means combining end-to-end into a single new list.
list_a = [1,3]
list_b = [2,4]
list_a + list_b     # [1,3,2,4]
list_a + int_list   # [1,3,0,1,2,3,4]

# lists can be repeated with the '*' operator. This means making a new list with the elements of the original repeated some number of times.
list_a*3    # [1,3,1,3,1,3]
[0]*5       # [0,0,0,0,0]

# You can check whether a specific value is an element of a list with the 'in' operator. This creates a boolean expression.
3 in int_list   # True
7 in int_list   # False
2 in [1,2,3]    # True
[2,1] in list_list  #True

# Finally, you can extract multiple elements from a list at once using a 'slice' in the subscript operator.
# A slice is two or three ints separated by colons ':'
# sequence[start:stop]
# sequence[start:stop:step]
# The version with only start and stop is the same as [start:stop:1]
int_list[0:2]   # [0,1]
float_list[2:3] # [6.9]
int_list[0:5:2] # [0,2,4]
int_list[0:4:2] # [0,2]

# Taking a slice always evaluates to another list, even if the slice contains only one element.
# The slice includes all the elements starting from the 'start' index, stopping at (and NOT including) the 'stop' index
# It jumps forward by 'step' indices between each element that gets included. Setting the 'step' to 2 skips over every 2nd element, for example.

# You can leave the start and stop in a slice blank. When you do, the slice will start at the beginning of the sequence or stop after it passes the last element.
int_list[:3]    # the same as int_list[0:3]
int_list[2:]    # [2,3,4]
int_list[:]     # the entire list [0,1,2,3,4]
int_list[::-1]  # the entire list... but stepping backwards [4,3,2,1,0]
int_list[::-2]  # What do you think this evaluates to?


# All of the operators described above can be used with str objects as well, and they work exactly the same way.
# Literal str are sequences of characters between pairs of quotation marks:
str1 = 'abcdefg'  # single quotes can be used
str2 = "foo and bar" # double quotes can be used
str3 = """Triple quotes
let a literal str
span multiple lines"""

str1[0]         # subscript with an index works fine
str1[:3]        # subscript with a slice
"2"+"argh"      # concatenate
"free "*2       # repeat
"f" in "free"   # check membership

# You cannot mix different sequence types with the binary operators. This:
# "abc"+[0,1,2]
#  would raise a TypeError, for example.

# There is one basic operation that can be performed with list that is not possible with str.
# You can replace individual values in a list variable using assignment
numbers = [7,22,11,34,17]
numbers[0] = -1
numbers[4] = -1
# Try it out in interactive mode. Try it with a str as well.

# This feature is called mutability (ability to change). list is a 'mutable' sequence type, str is 'immutable'.
# The other sequences that may come up in this course, 'tuple' and 'range' are both immutable.
# We will also cover one other container type, the 'dict' (dictionary), which is mutable.
