# The 'while' loop is the first statement we will look at that allows the same code to repeat multiple times
# Its syntax is almost identical to the if-statement:
#
# while condition:
#     body
#
# The difference between if-statements and while-statements is that when control reaches the end of a while loop's body, it returns to the condition and evaluates it again.
# If the condition continues to be true, the body gets executed again (then it returns to the condition again, etc...)
# If the condition has become false, while behaves just like an if: the body is skipped and program execution continues from the next line after the end of the loop.

# I would like to draw attention to some features of how 'while' is often used in practice.
# Copy this loop into a script of your own and try it out.
i = 0           # this line is the loop's 'initialization'
while i<5:      # the loop's condition
    print(i)
    i += 1      # the loop's 'increment'

# The condition in a loop often involves a variable whose only purpose is to control when the loop stops, the 'loop variable'
# Before the beginning of the loop, the loop variable is created and initialized. Often this initial value will allow the loop's body to run at least once.
# Somewhere inside the loop's body, there should be some code that modifies the loop variable (or at least potentially can), often called the 'increment'

# Putting it all together, we have 3 (or 4) parts to a typical loop:
# the initialization, the condition, the body, (and the increment which is really part of the body)
#
# initialization
# while condition:
#     body
#     increment

# Here are some examples of correct while-loops:
print("Counting down...")
i = 10
while i>0:
    print(i)
    i = i-1
print("Liftoff!")


print("Powers of 2 up to 2^10:")
stopping_point = 2**11
n = 1
while n < stopping_point:
    print(n)
    n = n*2

# You can nest loops just like if-statements
i = 0 
while i<5:
    # the body of the outer loop is the entire inner loop. All 3 parts.
    j = 0
    while j<4:
        print(i,j," Sum:",i+j)
        j += 1
    # the outer loop's increment comes after the inner loop
    i += 1

# Loops are commonly used to do something with each individual element of a sequence.
# In Python, this is always done with a 'for'-loop rather than a while-loop.
# We will learn about for-loops later, but just to show another example, here is what that looks like with a while-loop:
my_list = [5,16,8,4,2,1]
i = 0
while i < len(my_list):
    element = my_list[i]
    if element % 2 == 0:
        print(element)   #print only the even elements
    i += 1


# while-loops are for situations when you don't know in advance how many times the loop needs to run.
# For example, if you want to allow a user to choose when the loop exits:
word = input("Gimme a word: ")
while not (word[0] == "A" or word[0] == "a"):  #keep going until the input word starts with 'a' or 'A'
    word = input("Gimme a word: ")
