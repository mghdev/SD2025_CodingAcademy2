# Write a function called 'vectorSum'
# It should take two lists of numbers as arguments. The lists have to be the same length.
# The function should return a new list whose elements are the sum of the elements at the same index from the two input lists.
# For example:
#   vectorSum([0,1],[2,2]) should return [2,3]
#   vectorSum([3,-1,-1],[-1,-2,4]) should return [2,-3,3]

# Write a function called 'dotProduct'
# It should take two lists of numbers as arguments. The lists have to be the same length.
# The function should return the dot product (also called 'inner product') of the two lists
# If you're not sure what that means, ask! (or Google it)
