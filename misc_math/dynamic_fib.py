#=======================
# TODO
# Write a main function to test your fibonacci
# If you implemented dynamic programming correctly, it should run about as fast as an iterative (loop-based) version
# The naive recursive version will start taking a long time for inputs as low as 40-50 and take more time than the class period for n=100, for example.
