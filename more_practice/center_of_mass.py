# TODO
# We have a bunch of balls of equal weight distributed at different points (x,y), and we would like to know where their center of mass is.
# Write a function that takes a list of pairs of numbers as an argument.
# It should return a single pair of numbers that is the average of all the values in the input list.

# TODO
# We have 2 balls of different weight on the ends of a metal rod, and we would like to know where its center of mass is.
# Write a function that takes 4 arguments: 2 pairs of (x,y) coordinates and 2 mass numbers for how much mass is located at each of those points.
# Return the location of the center of mass.
# Hint: this will look like  k*(x1,y1) + (1-k)*(x2,y2) where k and 1-k are the proportion of the total mass in each ball.
