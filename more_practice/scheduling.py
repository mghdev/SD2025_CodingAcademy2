# TODO
# We have a bunch of jobs that we would like to divide equally among some workers.
# We'll start by looking at a case where we have 3 workers.
# Write a function 'divideWork3' that takes a list of numbers as an argument, representing the time it takes to complete various jobs
# We want to separate the numbers from the work list into 3 sums that are as close together as we can make them
# The return value of 'divideWork3' should be a list of 3 numbers, one for each worker, that represent the total time it will take for the jobs assigned to them.
# Loop through the work list and add each of its elements to whichever worker sum is currently the lowest

#=======================
# TODO
# Write a function 'divideWork' that takes a second argument: the number of workers we have.
