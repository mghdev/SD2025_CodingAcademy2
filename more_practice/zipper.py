# Write a function that takes 2 lists as arguments
# It should return a combined list whose elements alternate between the first and second argument lists
# e.g.  [ list1[0], list2[0], list1[1], list2[1], ... ]

def zipper(list1,list2):
    return []

#=======================
# TODO
# Write a function 'merge' that takes 2 lists as arguments; the elements of each list will be *sorted* in ascending order (smallest first)
# Return a combined list that is also sorted
# e.g. instead of always alternating which list you pull from, always take the smallest element that you haven't merged yet
# This one may be easier with a while-loop than a for-loop
