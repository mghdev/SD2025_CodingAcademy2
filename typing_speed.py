# TODO
# Write a program that measures a user's typing speed and accuracy.
# It should output a string of text with real words, then ask the user to try to copy it as fast as they can.
# After the user tries, output how long it took them and an accuracy score (ask instructor about the accuracy)
# BONUS: without specifying each one individually, randomize the text the user should copy so that there are at least 100,000 different possibilities.
