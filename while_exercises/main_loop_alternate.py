    #=======================
    # TODO
    # For this exercise, you will implement an alternative version of your loop from 'main_loop.py'  (do that one first)
    # Sometimes, for whatever reason, you may encounter situations in which it's easier to get new inputs/events in the main loop's body *after* processing the previous input.
    # Here is pseudocode describing a pattern you can use in those situations:
    #
    # Create a variable that tracks whether the loop should continue
    # Ask the user for text input
    # If the user typed "exit"
    #     Update the loop variable to indicate that the loop should terminate  
    # While the loop should continue
    #     (In general, process the input/events here)
    #     For this script specifically, output every 2nd character from the input
    #     Ask the user for text input
    #     If the user typed "exit"
    #         Update the loop variable to indicate that the loop should terminate    
    pass
